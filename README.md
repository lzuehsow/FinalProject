# The Dueling Association
Get your wands ready! This is a Software Design final project brought to you by Lydia Zuehsow (@Oktober13) and Emily Yeh (@YehEmily).

## What is this?
This project is a fanmade Harry Potter dueling game. In this game, the player battles against Voldemort. Voldemort casts a number of spells, which inflict damage on the player. The player can return fire by waving their own wand in certain patterns, thereby casting spells.

This is our final project for our Spring 2016 Software Design class at the Olin College of Engineering. We are both huge nerds when it comes to Harry Potter, so we thought it would be pretty rad to create a physical magic dueling game.

If you would like to see our website, it can be viewed here! https://sites.google.com/site/theduelingassociation/

## Installation
There are a few packages you may need to install in order to play. 

#### Installing OpenCV
``` python
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
```

#### Installing pygame
``` python
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

#### Installing imutils
``` python
pip install imutils
```

#### Installing argparse
``` python

## How to Play
Simply grab a green object, which will act as your wand. If you run our code, you will be faced with Voldemort and an instant volley of attacks! You must wave your wand in a recognizeable pattern to cast spells that can hurt Voldemort back.
